# Numerical-Variable-Visualization
Numerical variable is  variable in statistics that represents numbers. There are two main types of numerical variables:

Discrete numerical variable: This is a variable that can only take distinct numeric values. It reperesets whole numbers and have a finite number of possibilities, for example, number of cars, number of children.

Continuous numerical variable: A variable that can take any real value within a certain interval. The variable can have an infinite number of possible values and is impossible to coun for example, weight, height.

This project includes the following visualizations:
Histogram: Visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
Scatter plot: Explores the relationship between numerical variables. The relationship can be positive or negative
Box plot: Identifies outliers and summarizes the distribution of numerical data.
